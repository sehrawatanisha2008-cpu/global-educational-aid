    <!-- WHY THIS PROJECT -->
    <section class="why">
      <h2>Why Global Education Aid?</h2>
      <p>
        Many students miss genuine international scholarships due to
        misinformation, lack of guidance, or scattered resources.
      </p>
      <p>
        I created Global Education Aid to bring verified, trusted
        scholarships into one simple platform that students can rely on.
      </p>
      <p>
        This project reflects my interest in global education access,
        student empowerment, and building real-world solutions using technology.
