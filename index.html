            <p>
                Global Educational Aid is an independent student-built platform created
                to help learners identify genuine international scholarships and funding
                opportunities from official sources.

            <h2>Purpose and Impact</h2>
            <p>
                Many students struggle to find reliable scholarship information due to
                misinformation, paid agents, and unverified websites. This platform aims
                to reduce that confusion by listing only official and trusted programs.
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>Verified government and university scholarships</li>
                <li>No paid promotions or third-party agents</li>
                <li>Focus on merit-based and fully funded opportunities</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                The platform is designed and maintained independently with the goal of
                making scholarship discovery simpler and more transparent for students.
