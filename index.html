  <h2>Our Impact</h2>
  <p>
    Global Educational Aid is built to help students—especially from
    underrepresented and middle-income backgrounds—access verified,
    scam-free international scholarships.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>✔ Curated only official government & university scholarships</li>
    <li>✔ No agents, no middlemen, no paid listings</li>
    <li>✔ Focused on fully funded & merit-based opportunities</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    This project is independently built and maintained by a student who
    understands how confusing and misleading scholarship information can be.
